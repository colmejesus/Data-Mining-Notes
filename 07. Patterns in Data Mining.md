## Finding Data patterns mean that there is a correlation between two or more than two data points in a data set that is predictable. When you find a pattern among data points, you can have a good idea as to when and where something will happen. When you have a lack of pattern in your data, it is defined as having 'true randomness'

## Finding pattern in data is a helps organization make good decision based on the patterns they've found. For e.g. if you have a store, you can initially start with stocking up your store with various items and as you start selling them you can record the transactions which can later help you identify what sells and what isn't selling, this whole process can be termed as finding a pattern, which will help you make a better business decision later when you re-stock items for your store. This is a very basic example and there are much more sophisticated application of pattern recognition in data mining


## Some of the processes that help in finding pattern/functionalities of data mining:

### 1. Characterization and Discrimination

### 2. Outlier Detection

### 3. Clustering Analysis

### 4. Classification and Regression

### 5. Associations and Correlations


# Characterization and Discrimination:

## Data entries can be described as classes or concepts. For e.g. suppose you run a hardware store selling computer parts. You can have different 'classes' of items for e.g. A computer can be one class of product and a printer can be another, classes can be divided based on the characteristics of an object i.e. what it does. A customer that spends between than Rs. 25,000-10,00,000 /- can come under the concept of 'Big Spender' and a user that spends less Rs. 25,000 can be classified under the concept of 'Small Spender' 

## It can be really useful for businesses to describe individual classes and concepts in a concise, precise and summarized terms.

## Descriptions that summarize such data entries in classes and concepts are called class/concept description. 

## These descriptions i.e. if we go by examples 'big spender or small spender' or 'computer or printer' can be acquired using data characterizations i.e. by concisely summarizing the  characteristics of data entries under study (often called target class) and/or by the means of Discrimination, which is comparison of one class of data with another, single class or a set of classes/data entries (often called contrasting classes) 

### 1. Characterization: It is a process that classifies and summarizes data entries (target class of data) on the basis of their characteristics. 

### 2. Discrimination: Discrimination as described earlier is a process that summarizes/classifies data entries/target classes by comparing its features against the general features of a single or a set of contrasting classes. For example, you can classify a set of people as 'young buyer' by comparing them with another set of people. The characteristics of a target class that is being compared to a contrasting class can be specified by a user, for example a user can specify the age of people they want to compare while trying to find out what their buying behaviors are i.e. the kind of things people buy. 

### There are many techniques that allow users to perform characterizations and discrimination on target classes for e.g.  Data Cube Based OLAP Roll Up Operation.

## Data which corresponds to used-specified class (characteristics defined by user) for example, a user might want to find out about the products whose sales increased by say 20% previous year, can be acquired by executing a SQL query if the data exists on a SQL database.

## The output of the data characterization can be presented in various forms like bar chart, pie chart, data cubes, multidimensional tables etc.
