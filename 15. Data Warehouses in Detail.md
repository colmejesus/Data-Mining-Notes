## According to William H. Inmon, a leading architect in the construction of data warehousing systems, "A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile collection of data in support of management's decision-making process"

## This is a short but comprehensive defecation of a data warehouse that covers all the aspects of its functions. The four keywords, subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile are what separate data warehouses from other data repository systems like Relational Databases, Transaction Processing Systems and File Systems. Let's take a closer look at each of them:

### Subject-Oriented: 

#### When compared to other data repositories like a transaction processing system, which is concerned with all day to day transactions of people or a file system, which store all kind of structured, and unstructured data, a data warehouse is organized around major subjects such as customer, supplier, product, and sales and focuses on modeling and analyzing the data collected around these subjects to facilitate business decisions.

#### Hence, data warehouses typically provide a simple and concise view of a particular subject by excluding data that is not useful in the supporting the decision-making process. 

### Integrated:

#### A data warehouse is usually created by integrating/combining data from multiple heterogeneous (source with different kinds of data), such as relational databases, flat files and online transaction records etc.

#### Data cleaning and data integration techniques are applied to ensure consistency in aspects like naming conventions, encoding structures, attribute measure (like having same unit of measurement across data collected from different sources) and so on. 

## Time variant: 

#### Data are stored to provide information from an historic perspective (data focusing on attributes, spanning the past 5â€“10 years). Every key structure in the data warehouse contains, implicitly or explicitly, a time element. i.e. there are data structures like a data cube that support looking at a data multidimensionally, across time, if a user wishes.  

## Non-Volatile:

#### Non-volatility of a data warehouse refers to the stability and immutability of the stored data over time. In other words, once data is loaded into the data warehouse, it should not be changed, deleted or updated. This is in contrast to transactional systems, where data can be updated in real-time. Non-volatility ensures that historical data remains unchanged, allowing for consistent and accurate analysis and reporting of long-term trends and patterns.

## Multi-Tier Architecture of A Data Warehouse: 

### Data warehouse has a three tier architecture, each tier of the data warehouse has its own function, here's what they do:

#### 1. Bottom tier: It consists of Data Warehouse servers which, usually a relational database system, which collects, cleans and loads the data from multiple sources into a unified format, through a process called ETL (Extraction, Transform, Load):

#### Extraction: This is the process of retrieving data from various sources such as databases, flat files, or other systems. The data is usually extracted from the source systems in its raw form and stored in a staging area.

#### Transformation: This is the process of converting the extracted data into a format that can be loaded into the data warehouse. The transformation process includes data cleaning, data enrichment, data standardization, and data aggregation.

#### Loading: This is the process of inserting the transformed data into the data warehouse. The data is loaded into the appropriate tables, ensuring that the relationships between tables are preserved, and the data is properly stored for reporting and analysis purposes.


#### 2. Mid-tier: Mid-tier consist of OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) server used for faster processing of data which is implemented either a using a ROLAP Model (Relational On-Line Analytic Processing) or MOLAP Model (Multidimensional On-Line Analytics Processing). These systems map the data to a multidimensional data structure called a data cube, the data structure looks like this:

#### 3. Top Tier: It consists of a front end/user interface which allows user to make reports on the data and to use data analysis tools to make better decisions.

## Metadata Repository:

### A metadata repository in a data warehouse is a database that stores information about the data stored in the data warehouse. It's essentially a catalog of information about the data, including definitions, relationships, and descriptions of the data elements, tables, and other components of the data warehouse.

### The metadata repository is used for several important purposes, including:

#### 1.  Data management: It helps data administrators manage and maintain the data warehouse by providing information about the structure and content of the data.
    
#### 2.  Data governance: It helps ensure the consistency and accuracy of data by providing a centralized source of information about data definitions and relationships.
    
#### 3.  Data discovery: It helps users find the data they need by providing a centralized source of information about the data elements and their relationships.
    
#### 4.  Performance optimization: It helps optimize query performance by providing information about the physical storage of data and the best ways to access it.
    

### In simple terms, the metadata repository is used to provide information about the data stored in the data warehouse, making it easier to manage, understand, and use the data effectively.

### A metadata repository should contain information about the data stored in a data warehouse, including:

#### Data definitions: Detailed information about the data elements, such as name, data type, length, format, and descriptions.

#### Data relationships: Information about the relationships between data elements, such as parent-child relationships and associations between tables.

#### Data lineage: Information about the origin, transformation, and movement of data within the data warehouse, including the source systems and the processes used to extract, transform, and load the data.

#### Data quality information: Information about the quality of the data, such as completeness, accuracy, and consistency.

#### Business definitions: Information about the business context of the data, including business terms, definitions, and rules.

#### Technical metadata: Information about the technical aspects of the data warehouse, such as database schemas, indexes, and partitioning strategies.

#### Security and access control information: Information about who can access the data and how they can access it, including roles, permissions, and security policies.

### In summary, a metadata repository should contain comprehensive information about the data stored in a data warehouse, including data definitions, relationships, lineage, quality, business context, technical aspects, and security information.
