### What is Lift?

The lift measure calculates how often two items occur together in a dataset compared to how often they are expected to occur together by chance, i.e. how often two items occur together than we would expect them to occur together by chance

The formula for calculating Lift is:

Lift(A, B) = Support(A, B) / Support (A) x Support(B)

The value of Lift can range from 0 to Infinity. A Lift value of 1 indicates that there is no association between the two items, a value greater than 1 indicates that there is a positive association between items, and a value smaller than 1 indicates that there is a negative association between items.

For example, let's consider a dataset of customers' purchases at a grocery store. Suppose we want to find out if there is an association between buying bread and buying butter. We can use the Lift measure to evaluate this association.

Suppose we have the following information:

The total number of transactions in the dataset is 1000
The number of transactions that contain bread is 700
The number of transactions that contain butter is 500
The number of transactions that contain both bread and butter is 300
Using the formula above, we can calculate the Lift value as follows:

Lift(bread, butter) = (300 / (700 * 500)) = 0.000857

This value is less than 1, which indicates a negative association between buying bread and buying butter. In other words, customers who buy bread are less likely to buy butter, and vice versa.

In summary, the Lift measure in Association Mining is a statistical measure that is used to evaluate the strength of the association between two items in a dataset. It calculates the deviation of the observed frequency of co-occurrence of two items from the expected frequency of co-occurrence. The higher the Lift value, the stronger the association between the two items.
