## Classification and regression are two types of supervised learning, which is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset.

## Classification is the process of predicting the class or category of a given data point. It is used to solve problems where the output is a discrete value, such as yes/no, true/false, or a specific category. For example, a classification model could be used to predict whether an email is spam or not, or to predict the type of fruit based on its characteristics.

## Regression is the process of predicting a continuous value. It is used to solve problems where the output is a numerical value, such as the price of a house, the temperature, or the stock price. For example, a regression model could be used to predict the price of a house based on its characteristics, or to predict the number of units of a product that will be sold next month.

## Both regression and classification models are derived based on the analysis of a set of data also known as 'Training Data' and is later tested on a set of data called 'test data'. The process of splitting Training and Testing data is called Train-Test Split. Test data is used to check the accuracy of the data model. 

## In simple terms, classification is used to predict the class of new data points, and regression is used to predict the numerical value of new data points.

## Classification and Regression may need to be preceded by a feature selection technique called Relevance Analysis, which attempts to identify attributes that are the most relevant to the Classification or Regression process. There are different ways to perform Relevance Analysis on a data set. It is done to reduce ddimensionsof a data set that will not eaffectthe ppredictivemodel, hence removing them will increase the speed of computation in general since the data getting processed is reduced.
