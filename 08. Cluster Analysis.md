## To understand cluster analysis, we first need to understand what class labels and supervised learning is. 

## Supervised learning is a machine learning algorithm which helps us in predicting data based on labeled data sets, which contains inputs and output values. It helps us compute output values for the new input values based on the labeled data set it was trained on. For example, suppose we have a data set of college students' final semester exam scores, which also tells us which of them got placed. The dataset contain marks for 5 subjects, math, networking, java programming, data mining, A.I. and labels (Is_placed or not_placed) telling us whether they got placed or not, respectively. We can train a model based on this data and predict whether a student in final semester will get placed or not based on his marks. This process of predicting output values for a set of new input values based on old input and output values is called Supervised learning.

## Class Labels: Class labels are discrete attributes whose values we want to predict based on the values of other attributes.

## Cluster Analysis is another machine learning algorithm that is used to help label unlabeled data by generating class labels by grouping data elements into different groups based on their attributes and 'inter-class' similarity.

## Each cluster can be seen a class of object from which rules (which help in prediction) can be derived. It also helps with Taxonomy Formation, i.e. the process of organizing and categorizing different type of data into a hierarchy of groups based on similarity and differences. It brings together similar things and separates dissimilar things.
