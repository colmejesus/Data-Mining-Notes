## Data Objects:

### In data mining data object refers to a single unit of data within a larger repository of data, it can be a row in a database table, a record in a spreadsheet or a set of related variables representing a specific observation or an event. 

### The data object is typically paired with several 'attributes or features' that describe the data object. Data objects are sometimes also called tuples and attributes are also referred to as dimensions, which is the more common term used in a data warehouse.

### In a data set, "observation" and "tuple" refer to the same concept: a single record or instance of data. An observation or tuple typically consists of several attributes or features that describe the data being recorded.

### For example, in a dataset of customer information, an observation might include the customer's name, age, address, and purchase history. Each attribute would represent a feature of the customer, and the combination of all the attributes would represent a single observation or tuple in the data set.

### In short, an observation and a tuple are interchangeable terms that refer to a single unit of data in a dataset.

### The Type of Attribute is determined by the set of possible values it can have, the types of attributes are:

#### 1. Nominal: Nominal values refer to categories or names, with no inherent order or structure. Examples of nominal values include colors (red, green, blues), city names (London, Paris, New Delhi) or Animal names (Lion, Dog, Rabbit)

#### 2. Ordinal: They are similar to nominal values, but they have an inherent order or rank. Examples of Ordinal values include: Star Rating (1 star to 5 star), Letter grades (A, B, C, D, C), or Income Level (Low, Medium, High)

#### 3. Binary: Binary values refer to the values that only have two options for e.g. Present or Absent, Yes or No, Married or Unmarried, Kid or Adult etc. 

#### 4. Numeric: Numeric values are numerical data, that doesn't follow an order  and can either be continuous i.e. there can be a infinite number of values that can be measured for e.g. a person's height or weight, or Discrete values i.e. measurements that cannot have infinite number of possible values that can be measured for e.g. number of children in a family.
