## Why do we need Similarity and Dissimilarity measures? 

### Similarity and Dissimilarity measures in data mining are used to quantify the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between two data objects. This information can be used to group data objects together (Clustering), classify objects based on similar pre-classified objects using classification or to find the nearest neighbor of the data object (technique used to recommend similar movies or in anomaly detection etc.)

#### Similarity: 
#### It is the numerical measure of how alike two data objects are, the measure often falls in the range of 0 or 1 

### With '0' reflecting that two object are completely dissimilar and '1' reflecting that the objects are completely similar, a value of 0.5 would reflect partial similarity and similarly a value of 0.10 will reflect very little similarity i.e. the value can fall anywhere between 0 and 1, it is higher when the objects are more alike. 

### Dissimilarity:
### It is the numerical measure of how different two data objects are. Unlike similarity measure it is lower when the two objects are more alike and higher when two objects are different i.e. the measure is opposite to the similarity measure. 

### The minimum value in dissimilarity measure is often 0 but the upper limit varies. 

#### Data Structures Used:

#### The data matrix: A data matrix is a two-dimensional table that contains the data objects in rows and their attributes in columns. The values in the matrix represent the characteristics of the objects, and these values can be used to calculate similarity and dissimilarity between the objects.

#### This dissimilarity matrix: 

##### A dissimilarity matrix, also known as a distance matrix, is a square matrix that contains the dissimilarity or distance between all pairs of data objects. The dissimilarity matrix is symmetrical, meaning that the dissimilarity between object A and object B is equal to the dissimilarity between object B and object A.

##### To estimate similarity and dissimilarity, the data matrix is used as an input to a similarity or dissimilarity measure, and the resulting output is a dissimilarity matrix. The dissimilarity matrix can then be used to visualize the relationships between data objects or to cluster similar objects together.

```javasript
  Attribute 1  Attribute 2
Object 1        0.5        0.9
Object 2        0.6        0.8
Object 3        0.7        0.7
```

##### To calculate the dissimilarity between Object 1 and Object 2, we can use Euclidean distance (it calculates the distance between two points in a multidimensional space) dissimilarity measure:

```java

d(Object 1, Object 2) = sqrt((0.5 - 0.6)^2 + (0.9 - 0.8)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.02) = 0.14

```

##### The resulting dissimilarity matrix would be:

```javascript
     Object 1  Object 2  Object 3
Object 1   0      0.14     0.17
Object 2   0.14   0       0.13
Object 3   0.17   0.13    0

```

#### A data matrix is made up of two entities or 'things', namely rows (for data objects) and columns (for attributes associated with them) therefore a data matrix is often called a 'two-mode matrix'

#### The dissimilarity matrix contains one kind of entry (dissimilarities) and so is called 'one-mode matrix'

#### Data in the form of a data matrix can be transformed into a dissimilarity matrix before applying algorithms like clustering.

## The most commonly used similarity measures are:

### 1. Euclidean Distance: Euclidean distance is a measure of the straight-line distance between two points in a multidimensional space. It is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the coordinates of the points.

#### Formula: Let p1 and p2 be two points with n attributes, the Euclidean distance between them is calculated as:

```java
d(p1, p2) = sqrt((p1_Attribute1 - p2_Attribute1)^2 + (p1_Attribute2 - p2_Attribute2)^2 + ... + (p1_Attribute_n - p2_Attribute_n)^2)

```

#### Example: Consider two points with values for two attributes:

```java
Point 1: Attribute 1 = 0.5, Attribute 2 = 0.9
Point 2: Attribute 1 = 0.6, Attribute 2 = 0.8
```

#### The Euclidean distance between Point 1 and Point 2 can be calculated as follows:

```java
d(Point 1, Point 2) = sqrt((0.5 - 0.6)^2 + (0.9 - 0.8)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.02) = 0.14
```

### 2. Manhattan Distance: Manhattan distance, also known as "taxi-cab" distance, is a measure of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points in a multidimensional space. Unlike Euclidean distance, it only takes the absolute values of the differences into account.

#### Formula: Let p1 and p2 be two points with n attributes, the Manhattan distance between them is calculated as:
```java
d(p1, p2) = |p1_Attribute1 - p2_Attribute1| + |p1_Attribute2 - p2_Attribute2| + ... + |p1_Attribute_n - p2_Attribute_n|
```

#### Example: Consider two points with values for two attributes:

```java
Point 1: Attribute 1 = 0.5, Attribute 2 = 0.9
Point 2: Attribute 1 = 0.6, Attribute 2 = 0.8
```

#### The Manhattan distance between Point 1 and Point 2 can be calculated as follows:

```java
d(Point 1, Point 2) = |0.5 - 0.6| + |0.9 - 0.8| = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2
```



### 3. Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is a measure of the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multidimensional space. It is commonly used to measure the similarity between two documents or text snippets.

#### Formula: Let p1 and p2 be two points with n attributes, the cosine similarity between them is calculated as:

```java
sim(p1, p2) = (p1_Attribute1 * p2_Attribute1 + p1_Attribute2 * p2_Attribute2 + ... + p1_Attribute_n * p2_Attribute_n) / (sqrt(p1_Attribute1

```

### Advantages of Cosine similarity: It is beneficial because even if two similar data objects are far apart, they could still have a smaller angle between them. 

### Smaller the angle, higher the similarity, cosine similarity captured the orientation (the angle) of data objects.

### 4. Minkowski Distance: Minkowski distance is a generalization of the Euclidean and Manhattan distances. It calculates the distance between two points in a multidimensional space based on a power parameter "p". If p = 2, it is equivalent to the Euclidean distance, and if p = 1, it is equivalent to the Manhattan distance.

Formula: Let p1 and p2 be two points with n attributes, the Minkowski distance between them with a power parameter p is calculated as:

```java
d(p1, p2) = (|p1_Attribute1 - p2_Attribute1|^p + |p1_Attribute2 - p2_Attribute2|^p + ... + |p1_Attribute_n - p2_Attribute_n|^p)^(1/p)
```

### Example: Consider two points with values for two attributes:

```java
Point 1: Attribute 1 = 0.5, Attribute 2 = 0.9
Point 2: Attribute 1 = 0.6, Attribute 2 = 0.8
```

The Minkowski distance between Point 1 and Point 2 with a power parameter p = 3 can be calculated as follows:

```java
d(Point 1, Point 2) = (|0.5 - 0.6|^3 + |0.9 - 0.8|^3)^(1/3) = (0.1^3 + 0.1^3)^(1/3) = (0.001 + 0.001)^(1/3) = 0.063
```
