## Graphs are a useful way to visualize data that lets us have insights that we won't have by just looking at the data in it raw form. 

## Univariate distribution:

### Univariate distribution is a statistical concept that refers to the distribution of a single variable. It describes the frequency or pattern of how a single variable's values are spread out over a range of values.

### For example, consider a sample of heights of 100 people. The univariate distribution of heights would describe the distribution of those 100 height values and show how frequently each height value occurs in the sample. This information can be visualized using a histogram, where the height values are divided into intervals (bins) and the number of people in each interval is represented by the height of a bar.

### Univariate distributions are useful for understanding the basic characteristics of a single variable, such as its central tendency (mean, median, mode), spread (range, variance, standard deviation), and shape (skewness, kurtosis). These characteristics can provide valuable insights into the data and help inform further analysis and decision-making.

### There are several types of graphs that can be used to visualize the univariate distribution of a dataset, including:

#### Histogram:

#### A histogram is a graph that represents the distribution of a set of data. It shows the frequency or number of times that values in a dataset fall into a set of specified ranges or bins.

#### For example, let's say you have a list of 100 people's ages. You could put those ages into 10-year bins, such as 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, etc. The histogram would then show how many people fall into each bin, with the height of the bar representing the frequency of people in that bin.

#### A histogram is useful for understanding the overall shape of a distribution, identifying the most frequent values (modes), and finding potential outliers. It provides a visual representation of the distribution of a single variable, making it easier to understand and communicate the data.

#### Here's a pictorial representation of a Histogram:

#### Q-Q Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot):

#### Quantile plots, also known as quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots, are a type of data visualization used to assess the distribution of a dataset by comparing the distribution of the data to a theoretical distribution.

#### A Q-Q plot is created by plotting the quantiles of the data against the quantiles of a theoretical distribution, such as the normal distribution. If the data follows the theoretical distribution, the points on the Q-Q plot will form a straight line. If the data deviates from the theoretical distribution, the points on the Q-Q plot will deviate from the straight line.

#### Q-Q plots provide a visual representation of the similarity or dissimilarity of the distribution of a dataset with a theoretical distribution, and can be used to identify outliers, skewness, and other features of the distribution. They are useful for detecting departures from normality, comparing the distributions of multiple datasets, and testing hypotheses about the distribution of a dataset.

#### Here's an example of 3 sets of Q-Q plots comparing three kinds of distributions:

#### Here's a video explaining the Q-Q plot:

### Another explanation of Q-Q plot in very simple terms:

##### Imagine you have two sets of data that represent the heights of two groups of people. One set of data represents the heights of a group of people in the United States, and the other set represents the heights of a group of people in Japan. To create a Q-Q plot, you would first sort both sets of data from shortest to tallest. Then, you would take the first data point from each set (the shortest person in the United States and the shortest person in Japan), and plot these two data points on the graph. You would repeat this process for the second data point, the third data point, and so on, until you've plotted all of the data points from both sets.

##### If the two sets of data have a similar distribution, the points on the Q-Q plot will form a straight line. This means that, for each data point in one set, the corresponding data point in the other set will be close in value. If the two sets of data have a different distribution, the points on the Q-Q plot will not form a straight line. This means that, for each data point in one set, the corresponding data point in the other set will be different in value.

#### In this example, a Q-Q plot can help us determine whether the distribution of heights in the United States is similar to the distribution of heights in Japan. If the points on the Q-Q plot form a straight line, this suggests that the distributions of heights in the two countries are similar. If the points on the Q-Q plot do not form a straight line, this suggests that the distributions of heights in the two countries are different.

## Bivariate Distribution:

### Bivariate distribution is when we look at two things/variable/data points at the same time and see how they are related.

### For example, let's say you want to see if the amount of time you spend playing video games is related to your school grades. You could collect this information and make a scatter plot, where you plot the amount of time you spend playing video games on one axis and your school grades on the other axis.

### By looking at the scatter plot, you can see if there is any pattern or relationship between the two things. For example, you might see that as you spend more time playing video games, your grades tend to go down, indicating a negative relationship between the two things.

### Bivariate distribution helps to see if two things are related and what the relationship between them might be. This can be useful for understanding and making predictions about how changes in one thing might affect the other.

## Scatter Plot: 

### A scatter plot is a graphical representation of a bivariate distribution. It's a type of plot used to examine the relationship between two variables.

### In a scatter plot, each data point is represented as a single point on the plot, with the position of the point determined by its values for the two variables. The horizontal axis typically represents one variable and the vertical axis represents the other.

### By plotting the points on the scatter plot, you can see if there is any pattern or relationship between the two variables. For example, you might see that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase, indicating a positive relationship. Or, you might see that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease, indicating a negative relationship.

### Scatter plots can be used to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data, and can provide insights into the relationship between two variables. They are a useful tool for exploratory data analysis and can be used in various fields, such as finance, psychology, and biology.

#### Example of a scatter plot, exploring the relationship between Test Scores and Hours Of Study:

## Positively VS Negatively Correlated Data:

### Positively correlated data refers to a relationship between two variables such that as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other variable. In other words, the two variables change in the same direction.

### Negatively correlated data refers to a relationship between two variables such that as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable decreases. In other words, the two variables change in opposite directions.

### For example, consider the relationship between height and weight in a sample of people. If height and weight are positively correlated, we would expect that people who are taller tend to weigh more than people who are shorter. On the other hand, if height and weight are negatively correlated, we would expect that people who are taller tend to weigh less than people who are shorter.

### A scatter plot is a useful tool for visualizing the relationship between two variables. To determine if the data is positively or negatively correlated, you should look at the pattern of the points on the scatter plot.

### In a positive correlation, the points on the scatter plot tend to form a upward slope, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases. The slope of the line of best fit, which can be added to the scatter plot to represent the relationship between the variables, will be positive.

### Here's a scatter plot showing positive vs negative vs no co-relation between two variables:
