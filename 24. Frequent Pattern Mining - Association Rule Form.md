Association rule helps find the relationships between items in an itemset by showing how frequently an item appears in an itemset. 

Given a set of transactions, we can find rules that will predict the occurrence of an item based on the occurrence of other items in a set of transactions. 

For example, let us consider an example, looking at this Database of the items purchased at a computer shop, we can imply certain predicates i.e. statements that may or may not be true, in our case these predicates will be related to the buying behaviors of the customer, here's the Database: 

![sample DB freq pattern mining example](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/b8/7a/a5/b87aa5df1b99b5f1757f566378d138e1.jpg)

Looking at this we can imply that 'For every purchase of a Laptop, a customer also bought a Speaker' since it is a statement where we are implying that for every purchase of 'x' there was a purchase of 'y', this can be mathematically written as:

buys (x,"Laptop") **⇒** buys (x, "Speaker") or buys (x, "Laptop") **⇒** buys (x, "Av-software")

This kind of statements can be assessed using association rules. Association rules give us the probability of, in our situation, a specific thing being purchased given some other product is purchased, by looking at the pairs of items in the database which are frequently purchased together. This is done by calculating the confidence and support values for all the items in the dataset. Here's what those are:

1. Support: It refers to the number of times items or a set of items appeared in a transaction, for e.g. Laptop with Speaker, or Av software with laptops.

2. Confidence refers to the likelihood a particular item or a set of items will appear in a 'transaction' given that another item or set of items is already present in the transaction.

Let's have a look at another example, trying to figure out how to calculate support and confidence values for items in a dataset. Let's have a look at the sample Database:

![support_confidence_calc](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e5/6b/bb/e56bbb6979bf3d35b48545b22cb0d4a1.jpg)

Let the minimum Support be 50% and minimum Confidence be:

Therefore, if we want to see if the proposition A implies B i.e. A⇒ C i.e. for every purchase of 'A', 'C' was also purchased passes the minimum threshold for Support and Confidence i.e. 50% or not we would calculate the probability of A and B, both being in a given set of Transactions out of all the transactions in that dataset. In our case:

There are 4 total transaction in the database above and out of those 4 there are only two transaction that have both A and C present in them i.e. Transaction ID: 2000 and 1000. Therefore, the probability of a transaction having both A and C items in it is = Transactions that have A and C in them / Total number of Transactions = 2/4 = 0.5 or 50%. 

Therefore, we can say that the Support value of A⇒C is 50%

In the case of calculating Confidence for A⇒ C we need to look only at the transactions that contain A and that also have C alongside them, in our case out of 4 transactions only three of them have A i.e. Transaction ID 2000, 1000 and 4000 and out of these 3 transaction only 2 contain both A & C. 

Therefore, confidence for A⇒C is = Total number of transaction with A & C / Total number of transaction with only A = 2/3 = 0.66 or 66%

Confidence is essentially calculating conditional probability, i.e. probability that a transaction having A also contains C.
