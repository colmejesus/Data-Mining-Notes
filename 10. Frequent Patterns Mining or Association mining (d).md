## It is a process that of identifying patterns or association among data points that occur frequently. 

## This process is used to find interesting correlation among objects that wouldn't have been apparent while simply browsing the data with naked eyes. 

## For example, when a person buys milk, there is a high probability they might buy bread or vegetables with the milk. Therefore, we can say that there is association between a person buying milk and buying bread. 

## By using  information acquired from association mining we can make beneficial business decisions like keeping bread and milk close to each other increasing the probability of them getting bought at once, we can also encourage buyers to buy them together by giving a small discount if they do. 

## Frequent pattern mining is specially useful in ecommerce basket analysis, which refers to analyzing items that people buy on an e-commerce website by checking what's in their cart, by doing that we can find out what products sell together so during the checkout process those products can be recommended to customers, it is also used in movie recommendation systems, similarly. 

## Here are some important definitions related to association mining:

### 1. Support: It refers to the number of times items or a set of items appeared in a transaction, for e.g. milk with bread, or cold drink with chips.

### 2. Confidence refers to the likelihood a particular item or a set of items will appear in a 'transaction' given that another item or set of items is already present in the transaction.

### 3. Maximal item set: Is a frequent itemset for which none of its immediate supersets are frequent.

#### {milk, bread} with a support of 3

### {milk, cereal} with a support of 2

### {milk, egg} with a support of 5

### {milk, egg, bread} with a support of 4

## In this example, {milk, egg, bread} is a maximal itemset. 

### 4. *Closed Item set: It is a frequent itemset that is a superset of maximal frequent itemset 

## Single Dimensional Association Rule: Is a type of association mining that focuses on finding associations between single items in a dataset. 

### For e.g. in an apparel showroom, a data mining system may find association like that a person buying a pair of shoes may also buy socks that go with the shoes, it can be written as buys(x, shoes) => buys(x, socks)

## ## Multi Dimensional Association Rule: Is a type of association mining that focuses on finding associations between multiple items in a dataset. 

### Here's an example, let's suppose we are performing analysis on a dataset of an electronic store. A data mining system may find associations like age(x, 20...30) âˆ§ income(x, 40k....90k) => buy(x, laptop)

Types of Frequent Patterns in Frequent Pattern or Association Mining:

1. Frequent Itemsets: These are the itemsets that occur frequently in a data set.
2. Association Rules: These rules are describing the relationships between items in a frequent dataset, for example, an association rule might describe "If a customer buys milk they 69% likely to buy bread along with it".
3. Time-series pattern: These are the patterns that describe the changes in itemsets over, for e.g. trend of music streaming on the internet since the start of streaming i.e. changes in genre, song duration, genre etc.
4. Sequential Patterns: These are the patterns that appear in a specific sequence, i.e. these pattern describe the sequence in which transactions take place. 
5. Sub-groups: Also known as sub-clustering or sub-populations refer to smaller group of items or entities that are similar to each other within a larger group.
