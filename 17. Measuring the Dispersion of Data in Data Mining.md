## Why is Dispersion measured?

### Dispersion measures how spread out the data is in a data set, it provides the range and variability of data and helps to identify patterns and outliers in data. In data mining, measuring dispersion is important for several reasons:

### 1. Understanding the distribution of Data: Dispersion helps to determine the shape of the data distribution and understand how the values in the dataset are distributed. This information can be useful in determining the presence of outliers, skewness, and other features that may impact data analysis.
### 2. Comparisons Between Data sets: Dispersion can be used to compare the spread of data between different datasets, which can be useful in detecting trends, patterns, and differences.
### 3. Sampling and Modeling: Dispersion is important in determining the sample size and variability in data. This information can be used to make informed decisions about the appropriate sample size and distribution to use when building models.

### Here are some real life applications of measuring dispersion:


#### 1.  Market analysis: Dispersion can be used to understand the distribution of consumer spending, which can help retailers to target their marketing efforts and make informed decisions about product pricing.
    
#### 2.  Medical research: Dispersion can be used to understand the variability in patient health outcomes, which can be useful in developing effective treatment plans and predicting patient outcomes.
    
#### 3.  Environmental monitoring: Dispersion can be used to understand the variability in environmental parameters, such as temperature, rainfall, or air quality, which can be useful in detecting trends and predicting future conditions.

## There are various ways of measuring dispersion or spread of data, here are a few of them:

### 1. Range
### 2. Percentile
### 3. Variance & Standard Deviation
### 4. Inter-quantile Range

## Range: 

### Range is a very simple measure of dispersion that represents the difference between the lowest and the highest values in a dataset, in simple terms range tells us how spread out the values are in a data set. 

### For example, consider a dataset of exam scores for a class of 10 students: `[60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 97, 98, 99, 99, 100]`. The highest score is 100 and the lowest score is 60, so the range is 100 - 60 = 40. This means that the scores in this dataset are spread out over a range of 40 points.

### The range provides a quick and simple way to assess the spread of the data, but it can be affected by outliers, or extreme values, in the dataset. For a more robust measure of dispersion, other measures, such as variance or standard deviation, may be used.

## Quantiles & Percentiles: 

### They are defined as points in a data set that divides the data into equal parts. For example, median is the middle Quantile that separates the lower half of the dataset from the upper half. Other common Quantile include the first 'Quartile' (Q1) i.e. it is a type of Quantile, which separates the lowest 25% of the dataset from the rest, and the third Quartile (Q3) which separates the top 25% of data from the rest of the data set. Quantiles provide a summary of the distribution of the data and can be used to identify patterns and outliers in data sets. 

### Percentiles are a measure that divides a dataset into 100 equal parts. Each percentile represents a specific value that separates a certain percentage of data from the rest of them, for example 50th percentile (also known as median), separates the lowest 50% of the data from the highest 50% of the data. The 25th percentile, also known as the first quartile, separates the lowest 25% of the data from the rest, and the 75th percentile, also known as the third quartile, separates the top 25% of the data from the rest. Percentiles provide a way to summarize the distribution of the data and can be used to identify patterns and outliers in the data. The median, quantiles and percentiles are some of the most commonly used .

#### Interquartile range (IQR): It is a measure of dispersion that represents the range between the First Quartile (Q1) and the Third Quartile (Q2). The quartiles divide the data into four equal parts, with Q1 representing the 25th percentile, and Q3 representing the 75th percentile.

#### The IQR provides a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of the data, and it is more robust to outliers or extreme values in the dataset than measures like range. The IQR is calculated as the difference between Q3 and Q1: IQR = Q3 - Q1.

#### For example, consider a dataset of exam scores for a class of 10 students: `[60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 97, 98, 99, 99, 100]`. To find the IQR, we first need to calculate the quartiles. The median (50th percentile) is 97, so Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data, `[60, 70, 80, 90, 95]`, which is 80, and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data, `[97, 98, 99, 99, 100]`, which is 99. The IQR is then calculated as 99 - 80 = 19. This means that the middle 50% of the data is spread out over a range of 19 points.

### Here's a great video explaining Quantiles in a little detail:

## Variance and Standard Deviation:

### Variance and standard deviation are measures of dispersion that provide information about how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean (average) value.

### Variance is a measure of the average squared deviation from the mean. It is calculated by finding the difference between each value in the dataset and the mean, squaring these differences, and taking the average of the squared differences. The formula for variance is:

## $$Variance = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}$$


### Where $x_i$ represents each value in the dataset, $\mu$ represents the mean of the dataset, and $n$ represents the number of values in the dataset.

### Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and it provides a measure of the average deviation from the mean. The standard deviation is a more interpretable measure than variance because it is expressed in the same units as the original data. The formula for standard deviation is:

## $Standard Deviation = \sqrt{Variance}$

### These measures of dispersion provide information about the spread of the data and can be used to identify patterns and outliers in the data. A small variance or standard deviation indicates that the data is clustered closely around the mean, while a large variance or standard deviation indicates that the data is spread out over a large range of values.

## Real life applications of Standard Deviation and Variance:

### Variance and standard deviation are commonly used in statistics and data analysis for the following purposes:

#### 1.  Characterizing the spread of data: Variance and standard deviation are measures of dispersion that provide information about how spread out the values in a dataset are relative to the mean. They are used to quantify the variability or spread of the data and can be used to compare the variability of different datasets.
    
#### 2.  Assessing the normality of data: Variance and standard deviation are often used to determine whether a dataset is approximately normally distributed. If a dataset is normally distributed, the mean, variance, and standard deviation can be used to describe its properties and make predictions about future observations.
    
#### 3.  Identifying outliers: Variance and standard deviation can be used to identify outliers in a dataset, which are values that are significantly different from the other values in the dataset. For example, values that are more than 3 standard deviations from the mean can be considered outliers.
    
#### 4.  Estimating risk: Variance and standard deviation are commonly used in finance to estimate risk associated with investments. For example, a high standard deviation for a stock's returns suggests that the stock's returns are volatile and therefore riskier.
    
#### 5.  Data compression: Variance and standard deviation can be used in data compression techniques to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored or transmitted. For example, the mean and standard deviation of a dataset can be used to reconstruct a smaller number of representative values that can be used to approximate the original dataset.
    

### These are just a few examples of the many applications of variance and standard deviation in various fields. Here's a good video that explain both of these concepts in details:

## Five Number Summary:

### 5 Number summary is a set of descriptive statistical values that provides a quick and concise way of summarizing the distribution of a dataset. The 5 number summary consists of the following values:

#### 1.  Minimum: The smallest value in the dataset.
    
#### 2.  First Quartile (Q1): The 25th percentile of the dataset, which separates the lowest 25% of the data from the rest.
    
#### 3.  Median (Q2): The 50th percentile of the dataset, which is the middle value of the dataset and separates the lower half of the data from the upper half.
    
#### 4.  Third Quartile (Q3): The 75th percentile of the dataset, which separates the highest 25% of the data from the rest.
    
#### 5.  Maximum: The largest value in the dataset.

## Box Plots and Outliers:

### Box plot, also known as box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation of a five-number summary. It is a type of data visualization that provides a compact and informative representation of the distribution of a dataset.

### In a box plot, the five-number summary is represented using a box and whiskers. The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) and contains 50% of the data. The median (Q2) is represented as a line inside the box, and the minimum and maximum values are represented by the ends of the whiskers, which extend from either side of the box to the minimum and maximum values, respectively.

### Outliers, or values that are significantly different from the rest of the data, are represented as individual dots outside the whiskers. These outliers can provide important information about the distribution of the data and can be used to identify patterns and relationships in the data, they are usually, a value higher/lower than 1.5 x IQR (Inter Quartile Range = Q3 -Q1)
