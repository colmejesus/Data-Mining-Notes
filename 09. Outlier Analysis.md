## In a data set, outliers are data points which are vastly different compared to other data points, for example suppose you made a model based on 'number of hours studied' of 100 college students, which has 'hours studied, and placed or not placed' as attributes, most of them below '2 hours' under 'hours studied' were not placed except  2 students, as their father owned the company they interviewed for. The model you created using this data set, that includes these outliers, will give wrong predictions for other students whose data might give the model as input. 

## Therefore, outliers affect the model's ability to generalize to new data, as you can see in the example, the model trained on outlier data may not be able to accurately classify or predict new input data, hence the need to analyze outliers and remove them. 

## Outlier analysis is a process that detects outliers in a data set, the process is also called anomaly mining. They are detected in a variety of way, one of the most common ways used are statistical tests like 'distance based methods' where distance of each data points from mean or median is calculated and the data points that are farther away from a specific threshold of are considered to be  outliers or 'Clustering' where the data points that don't lie near any cluster are considered to be outliers.

### Outlier analysis also helps with fraud detection for example in online purchases banks may monitor your behavior i.e. your location, the amount you usually spend online, where you spend your money and as soon as they detect your activity they might alert you and block the transaction to save you from the fraud.
