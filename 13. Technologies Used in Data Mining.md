## Database Systems: 

Database systems research focus on the creation, maintenance and use of databases for organizations and end-users. Database systems researchers have established highly recognized principles in data models, query languages, query processing, optimization methods, data storage, indexing and accessing methods. 

Database systems are often well known for their high scalability in processing very large data sets.

## Data Warehouses:

Recent database systems have integrated data analysis capabilities on database data using data warehousing and data mining facilities. Data warehouse is a system that collects/aggregates data from different sources and stores it into a central data storage to provide solutions to business problems.

In Data warehouses data is often times stored in a multidimensional data structure called data cube, it holds on to aggregated information in such a way that it makes it easier for OLAP tools in warehouses to process information more quickly and effectively. Data in data cubes can have more than three dimensions to it.

The data cube model not only facilitates OLAP in multidimensional databases, but also promises multidimensional data mining, i.e. the process of analyzing multidimensional data to uncover patterns, correlations and relationships among the variables in the data set.

## Information Retrieval: 

Information Retrieval (IR) is the study concerned with searching and retrieving information from a collection of documents. It involved processing, querying and indexing a large amount of unstructured text data to locate relevant information, unlike using SQL used to query structured data in a database. 

Some popular tools used for IR are Google, Bing and Yahoo as well as open source tools like Elasticsearch, Apache Lucerne and Solr. These tools allow users to search and retrieve information from large collections of text documents and offer other services like query expansion, document clustering, relevance ranking etc. 

The queries are formed mainly by keywords, which don't have complex structure like SQL queries.

IR uses probabilistic models to find similarities between documents, each document is represented as a vector of numbers, where each number represents the frequency of a specific word in the document. By comparing the vectors, you can determine the similarity between the documents. The more similar the vectors, the more similar the documents.

# Applications of Data Mining

Data mining is used in web page analysis, i.e. web pages are categorized into different categories based on the content of the web pages and in algorithms like PageRank and HITS (Hyper-Link Induced Topic Search) that determine the importance of web pages, these algos assign a score to the pages on the based on the number and quality of other webpages that are pointing towards it.

Data mining is also used in Basket Analysis which is a process that is used to analyze carts on e-commerce websites that help organizations to understand what a person might want to buy, understanding consumer behaviors might help them make their product suggestions better leading to increase in sales. 

Movie and video recommendation systems on video streaming website. User's behavior is monitored to recommend them with content similar to the content they are already watching, increasing the time they spend on the platform.

To demonstrate the importance of data mining and its research and development in general, we briefly look at two highly successful and popular applications of data mining which organizations and end users heavily rely on:

1. Business Intelligence (BI): It is the core of today's modern businesses. It is critical for businesses to acquire a better understanding of the main aspects of their businesses i.e. the customers, the market, supply, their resources and the competition. 
   
   BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive view of business operations with the help of data that is collected to support BI tools and operations. BI tools offer reporting, analytical processing, benchmarking, predictive analysis etc. Without these tools and data mining technologies to support these tools, businesses won't be able to perform effective market analysis like comparing customer feedback on similar product or discovering strength and weaknesses of their competitors products by comparing feedback on their product with their competitor's, hence making smart decisions driven by data will be difficult to do. 
   Data mining is the core of business analysis, online analytical processing tools in BI depend on tools like Data Warehouses and multidimensional data mining. 

   Techniques like clustering also plays a big role in customer relationship management and behavior analysis by clustering similar customers in the same groups. Using techniques like characterization and discrimination, we can understand the features of each customer group better.



2. Search Engines: Web search engines are specialized computer server that searches the web to display relevant results that fit user query, web engines also incorporate various data mining techniques as mentioned above, to do their job of listing web pages effectively and reliably. Web search engines are basically large scale data mining applications. 

    Various techniques like crawling (e.g. deciding which web pages should be crawled and how many of them should be crawled to show relevant results, i.e. crawling frequencies), indexing (selecting pages to index and deciding to which extent the index should be constructed) or deciding how to personalize search results based on the browsing patterns of the person who is searching the web.
