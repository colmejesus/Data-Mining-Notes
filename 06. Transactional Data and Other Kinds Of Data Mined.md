## Every record in a transactional database captures a customer's transaction, for example a database used to collect data for flight booking or a database as used in a supermarket to keep track of the purchases of a customer or a database keeping track of a user's click on a website.

## A transaction usually includes a unique transaction ID along with the list of items that make up the transactions such as items purchased in the transaction. A transaction database may have additional tables which can contain more information about the transactions for e.g. a sales person table to keep track of all the sales people selling an item or a delivery table to keep track of all the delivery addresses of goods after the transaction has completed. 

## Now suppose a mobile company that sells its products in many countries  need to get a report about how many units they sold for each model, per quarter, worldwide. Now this is where Data Warehouse becomes really useful since in our case data is physically spread across many databases across all the countries the company operates in. Data warehouse, rather than storing the details of each transaction, it may store the summary of sales per item type for each store.
