## Data warehouse is a system that collects/aggregates data from different sources and stores it into a central data storage to provide solutions to business problems. Data warehouse systems allows organizations to run powerful analysis on  huge volumes (petabytes) of data and historical databases in ways conventional databases won't allow. 

## Traditionally Data Warehouses were hosted on premise in organizations and primarily focused on extracting, cleaning and loading and maintaining that data on relational databases, but more recently data warehouses are being hosted on the cloud, and they also come with added analytics, visualization and presentation tools. 

### In Data warehouses data is often times stored in a multidimensional data structure called data cube, it holds on to aggregated information in such a way that it makes it easier for OLAP tools in warehouses to process information more quickly and effectively. Data in data cubes can have more than three dimensions to it.

## Architecture of a Data Warehouse:

### 1. Bottom tier: It consists of Data Warehouse servers which, usually a relational database system, which collects, cleans and loads the data from multiple sources through a process called ETL (Edit, Transform, Load)

### 2. Mid-tier: Mid-tier consist of OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) server used for faster processing of data which is implemented either a using a ROLAP Model (Relational On-Line Analytic Processing) or MOLAP Model (Multidimensional On-Line Analytics Processing)

### 3. Top Tier: It consists of a front end/user interface which allows user to make reports on the data and to use data analysis tools to make better decisions.
