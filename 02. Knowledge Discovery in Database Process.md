## The knowledge discovery process is a step-by-step process that helps extract non-obvious information and patterns from large data sets. KDD is a part of data mining, helping the business decisions by discovering relationships in data.

## The KDD process can be broken down into several steps:

### 1. Data collection: This step is self-explanatory, it is the process of gathering data which will later be used to analyze. Data can come from many places, like sensors, social media, video streaming platform, hospitals, schools etc. 

### 2. Data Integration: This step involves combining data from different sources into a single view/data set. It can be a complicated process since the data differ from sources to sources in context of format, semantics, structure etc. It is not considered a main step, but rather a sub-step or precursor to data cleaning. 

### 3. Data Cleaning: This step involves 'cleaning' i.e.removing inconsistent, incomplete or obsolete data from the data set which will not help us in extracting useful information from the data set and helps prepare the data for analysis. 

### 4. Data exploration: This step is about understanding the cleaned data, it includes visualizing data, finding pattern and trend in the data set, discovering relationship between variables.

### 5. Data modeling: This step involves creating the data models that will help capture the patterns that were discovered in the data explorations step.  These models can then be used to make prediction or classify new data.

### 6. Evaluation: This step involves evaluation of the data models we created in order to access their quality of prediction. This includes determining how well the models perform on a new set of data. 

### 7. Deployment: This step is about deployment of the data model, after the evaluation process so that it can be used to make informed business decisions.

### In the industry, media and research community, data mining is often used to refer to the entire process of KDD.
